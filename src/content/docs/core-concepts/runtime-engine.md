# LLM Runtime Engine

The runtime engine powers `forge run` — executing agent tasks via LLM providers with tool calling, conversation memory, and lifecycle hooks.

## Agent Loop

The core agent loop follows a simple pattern:

1. **Initialize memory** with the system prompt and task history
2. **Append** the user message
3. **Call the LLM** with the conversation and available tool definitions
4. If the LLM returns **tool calls**: execute each tool, append results, go to step 3
5. If the LLM returns a **text response**: return it as the final answer
6. If **max iterations** are exceeded: return an error

```
User message → Memory → LLM → tool_calls? → Execute tools → LLM → ... → text → Done
```

The loop terminates when `FinishReason == "stop"` or `len(ToolCalls) == 0`.

## LLM Providers

Forge supports multiple LLM providers with automatic fallback:

| Provider | Default Model | Auth |
|----------|--------------|------|
| `openai` | `gpt-5.2-2025-12-11` | API key or OAuth; optional Organization ID |
| `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | API key |
| `gemini` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | API key |
| `ollama` | `llama3` | None (local) |
| Custom | Configurable | API key |

### Configuration

```yaml
model:
  provider: openai
  name: gpt-4o
```

Or override with environment variables:

```bash
export FORGE_MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
forge run
```

Provider is auto-detected from available API keys if not explicitly set. Provider configuration is resolved via `ResolveModelConfig()` in priority order:

1. **CLI flag** `--provider` (highest priority)
2. **Environment variables**: `FORGE_MODEL_PROVIDER`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
3. **forge.yaml** `model` section (lowest priority)

### OpenAI OAuth

For OpenAI, Forge supports browser-based OAuth login (matching the Codex CLI flow) as an alternative to API keys:

```bash
forge init my-agent
# Select "OpenAI" -> "Login with browser (OAuth)"
# Browser opens for authentication
```

OAuth tokens are stored in `~/.forge/credentials/openai.json` and automatically refreshed.

### Organization ID (OpenAI Enterprise)

Enterprise OpenAI accounts can set an Organization ID to route API requests to the correct org:

```yaml
model:
  provider: openai
  name: gpt-4o
  organization_id: "org-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Or via environment variable (overrides YAML):

```bash
export OPENAI_ORG_ID=org-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The `OpenAI-Organization` header is sent on all OpenAI API requests (chat, embeddings, responses). Fallback providers inherit the primary org ID unless overridden per-fallback. The org ID is also injected into skill subprocess environments as `OPENAI_ORG_ID`.

### Fallback Chains

Configure fallback providers for automatic failover when the primary provider is unavailable:

```yaml
model:
  provider: openai
  name: gpt-4o
  fallbacks:
    - provider: anthropic
      name: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    - provider: gemini
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export FORGE_MODEL_FALLBACKS="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514,gemini:gemini-2.5-flash"
```

Fallback behavior:
- **Retriable errors** (rate limits, overloaded, timeouts) try the next provider
- **Non-retriable errors** (auth, billing, bad format) abort immediately
- Per-provider exponential backoff cooldowns prevent thundering herd
- Fallbacks are also auto-detected from available API keys when not explicitly configured

## Executor Types

The runtime supports multiple executor implementations:

| Executor | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `LLMExecutor` | Custom agents with LLM-powered tool calling |
| `SubprocessExecutor` | Framework agents (CrewAI, LangChain) running as subprocesses |
| `StubExecutor` | Returns canned responses for testing |

Executor selection happens in `runner.go` based on framework type and configuration.

## Running Modes

### `forge run` — Foreground Server

Run the agent as a foreground HTTP server. Used for development and container deployments.

```bash
# Development (all interfaces, immediate shutdown)
forge run --with slack --port 8080

# Container deployment
forge run --host 0.0.0.0 --shutdown-timeout 30s
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--port` | `8080` | HTTP server port |
| `--host` | `""` (all interfaces) | Bind address |
| `--shutdown-timeout` | `0` (immediate) | Graceful shutdown timeout |
| `--with` | — | Channel adapters (e.g. `slack,telegram`) |
| `--mock-tools` | `false` | Use mock executor for testing |
| `--model` | — | Override model name |
| `--provider` | — | Override LLM provider |
| `--env` | `.env` | Path to env file |
| `--enforce-guardrails` | `false` | Enforce guardrail violations as errors |

### `forge serve` — Background Daemon

Manage the agent as a background daemon process with PID/log management.

```bash
# Start daemon (secure defaults: 127.0.0.1, 30s shutdown timeout)
forge serve

# Start on custom port
forge serve start --port 9090 --host 0.0.0.0

# Stop the daemon
forge serve stop

# Check status (PID, uptime, health)
forge serve status

# View recent logs (last 100 lines)
forge serve logs
```

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `start` (default) | Start the daemon in background |
| `stop` | Send SIGTERM (10s timeout, SIGKILL fallback) |
| `status` | Show PID, listen address, health check |
| `logs` | Tail `.forge/serve.log` |

The daemon forks `forge run` in the background with `setsid`, writes state to `.forge/serve.json`, and redirects output to `.forge/serve.log`. Passphrase prompting for encrypted secrets happens in the parent process (which has TTY access) before forking.

## File Output Directory

The runtime configures a `FilesDir` for tool-generated files (e.g., from `file_create`). This directory defaults to `<WorkDir>/.forge/files/` and is injected into the execution context so tools can write files that other tools can reference by path.

```
<WorkDir>/
  .forge/
    files/        ← file_create output (patches.yaml, reports, etc.)
    sessions/     ← conversation persistence
    memory/       ← long-term memory
```

## Conversation Memory

For details on session persistence, context window management, compaction, and long-term memory, see the [Memory System](/docs/core-concepts/memory-system) documentation.

## Hooks

The engine fires hooks at key points in the loop. See [Hooks](/docs/core-concepts/hooks) for details.

## Streaming

The current implementation (v1) runs the full tool-calling loop non-streaming. `ExecuteStream` calls `Execute` internally and emits the final response as a single message on a channel. True word-by-word streaming during tool loops is planned for v2.
