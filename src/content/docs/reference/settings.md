# Settings

Forge settings are the **developer-surface** configuration: which channels are offered/enabled, the default model and the model **gateway** endpoint, and which builtin tools are offered. They layer, with a **user** level and an enterprise **managed** level an org can drop via MDM — modeled on [Claude Code settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings) + [managed settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/managed-settings).

> **Settings vs. policy.** Settings are the *positive* surface — enablement, defaults, gateway injection. They are **separate** from [platform policy](/docs/security/platform-policy), the *negative* surface (deny / restrict / tighten), which the control plane injects server-side. A managed settings **lock** (an authoritative allowlist) is the positive counterpart to a policy **deny**; both can coexist.

## Precedence

Highest wins. A managed value cannot be overridden by a lower layer.

| # | Layer | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Managed** | `managed-settings.json` in the fixed OS system dir (+ `managed-settings.d/*.json`) — no env/flag override |
| 2 | **Command line** | `--settings <file>` |
| 3 | **Project local** | `.forge/settings.local.json` |
| 4 | **Shared project** | `.forge/settings.json` |
| 5 | **User** | `~/.forge/settings.json` (or `FORGE_USER_SETTINGS`) |

**Merge:** list keys (`channels.enabled`, `tools.builtins.enabled`, and — when unlocked — `models.available_models`) are **unioned** across layers. Scalars (`models.default.*`, `models.gateway.*`) take the highest layer's non-empty value. `env` maps merge with higher keys winning.

**Managed settings are not developer-overridable.** They load from a **fixed OS system path with no env or flag override** — a developer running the shipped binary cannot redirect, replace, or drop the managed layer (matching Claude Code, whose managed path is fixed for exactly this reason). Tamper-resistance is the OS file permissions on that path: on a managed machine it is root-owned and not user-writable.

**Managed lock:** when a **managed** layer sets `models.available_models`, it replaces the union rather than adding to it, so no lower layer — and no developer at runtime — can widen it. Combined with the fixed path above, this is a real allowlist within the settings surface. [Platform policy](/docs/security/platform-policy) (server-side, control-plane injected) remains the defense-in-depth forbidden-model enforcement — use settings for the org's allowed/default set, policy to hard-forbid regardless of client state. An empty/absent `available_models` is "unset" (no lock), not "lock to zero models".

### Managed settings locations (per OS)

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `/Library/Application Support/forge/managed-settings.json` |
| Linux / WSL | `/etc/forge/managed-settings.json` |
| Windows | `C:\Program Files\forge\managed-settings.json` |

These paths are **fixed** — there is no env var to redirect them (a developer must not be able to point the managed layer at a file they control). Drop-in directory `managed-settings.d/` next to the file is merged in alphabetical order (primary first) — name files `10-…`, `20-…` to control order. Deliver via MDM, an image build, or config management, and ensure the path is root-owned / not user-writable. The forge system dir is shared with the policy layer, so managed settings sit **alongside** `policy.yaml` (the deny layer) — e.g. `/etc/forge/managed-settings.json` next to `/etc/forge/policy.yaml`.

## Schema

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "enabled": ["slack", "telegram"]
  },
  "models": {
    "default":         { "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" },
    "available_models": ["anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6", "openai/gpt-4o"],
    "gateway":         { "base_url": "https://gw.corp/v1", "auth_scheme": "apikey_header", "auth_header_name": "apikey" }
  },
  "tools": {
    "builtins": { "enabled": ["http_request", "datetime_now", "math_calculate"] }
  },
  "env": { "HTTP_PROXY": "http://proxy.corp:8080" }
}
```

| Key | Type | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `channels.enabled` | `[]string` | Channel adapters offered/enabled by `forge init` / `run --with` / `channel add` |
| `models.default` | `{provider, model}` | Default provider+model when none is given explicitly (seeds `forge try`/`init`) |
| `models.available_models` | `[]string` | Allowlist of `<provider>/<model>`; a **managed** value is the authoritative allowlist (no lower layer or developer can widen it — see Managed lock). Empty = unset |
| `models.gateway` | `{base_url, auth_scheme, auth_header_name}` | Model gateway endpoint injected into the scaffolded `forge.yaml` model block — mirrors the [`model` config](/docs/reference/forge-yaml-schema) fields and the outbound [`auth_scheme`](/docs/security/authentication) |
| `tools.builtins.enabled` | `[]string` | Builtin tools offered/defaulted |
| `env` | `map[string]string` | Environment defaults |

## Inspect

```bash
forge settings          # loaded layers (with their paths) + effective settings
forge settings show --json
forge settings show --settings ./ci-settings.json   # add a CLI-precedence layer
```

The output lists each loaded layer lowest → highest, flags a managed `available_models` **LOCK**, and prints the merged effective settings. The default (human) view **masks `env` values** as `***` (keys shown) since `env` may carry secrets; `--json` emits values **verbatim** for your own machine-readable dump — don't paste it into shared channels.

## What consumes settings today

- **`forge try`**: a configured `models.default` seeds the provider/model when no flag is given; `models.gateway` is injected into the scaffolded `forge.yaml` model block (`base_url` / `auth_scheme` / `auth_header_name`); `tools.builtins.enabled`, when set, overrides the quickstart's default builtin set.
- **`forge init`**: `models.gateway` is injected into the scaffolded `forge.yaml` (both modes). In **non-interactive** mode, `models.default` seeds the provider/model and `tools.builtins.enabled` seeds builtins when the corresponding flag is omitted — so a settings default even satisfies the otherwise-required `--model-provider`. `channels.enabled` gates the chosen channels: non-interactive `--channels` fails immediately, while interactive picks are validated at the end (the wizard doesn't yet filter its options by the allowlist — a late failure until wizard-filtering lands). (Interactive-wizard defaulting is a follow-up; the wizard is authoritative for what it collects, and only the gateway — which has no wizard step — is injected there.)
- **`channels.enabled` gating**: when non-empty, `channels.enabled` is the allowlist of adapters that may run. It gates **all three** channel entry points: **`forge run --with <x>`** and **`forge channel serve <x>`** (the standalone runner) refuse to start a non-enabled adapter, and **`forge channel add <x>`** refuses to scaffold one. The gate runs before the [policy](/docs/security/platform-policy) deny filter. Empty = unconstrained (every registered adapter available). This is the positive enablement surface; policy remains the deny surface — settings decide "is it offered?", policy decides "is it forbidden?".

Remaining follow-ups (tracked on the settings epic): interactive-wizard defaulting for `forge init`, and additional managed delivery mechanisms (server-managed control-plane fetch, macOS config profile, Windows registry).
