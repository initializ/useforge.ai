## Audit Logging

All runtime security events are emitted as structured NDJSON to stderr with correlation IDs for end-to-end tracing.

### Event Types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session_start` | New task session begins |
| `session_end` | Task session completes (with final state) |
| `tool_exec` | Tool execution start/end (with tool name) |
| `egress_allowed` | Outbound request allowed (with domain, mode) |
| `egress_blocked` | Outbound request blocked (with domain, mode) |
| `llm_call` | LLM API call completed (with token count) |
| `guardrail_check` | Guardrail evaluation result |
| `auth_verify` | Inbound request authenticated successfully (with `provider`, `user_id`, `org_id`, `token_kind`) |
| `auth_fail` | Inbound request rejected (with `reason`, `token_kind`) |
| `agent_card_published` | Agent Card finalized at startup or hot-reload (with `name`, `version`, `protocol_version`, `url`, `skill_count`, `capabilities`, `security_schemes`, `card_size_bytes`, `card_sha256`). See [Agent Card reference](/docs/reference/a2a-agent-card). |

### Example

```json
{"ts":"2026-02-28T10:00:00Z","event":"session_start","correlation_id":"a1b2c3d4","task_id":"task-1"}
{"ts":"2026-02-28T10:00:01Z","event":"tool_exec","correlation_id":"a1b2c3d4","fields":{"tool":"tavily_research","phase":"start"}}
{"ts":"2026-02-28T10:00:01Z","event":"egress_allowed","correlation_id":"a1b2c3d4","fields":{"domain":"api.tavily.com","mode":"allowlist","source":"proxy"}}
{"ts":"2026-02-28T10:00:05Z","event":"tool_exec","correlation_id":"a1b2c3d4","fields":{"tool":"tavily_research","phase":"end"}}
{"ts":"2026-02-28T10:00:06Z","event":"session_end","correlation_id":"a1b2c3d4","fields":{"state":"completed"}}
```

The `source` field distinguishes in-process enforcer events from subprocess proxy events.

### Workflow correlation

When the inbound A2A request carries the orchestrator's correlation headers (`X-Workflow-ID`, `X-Workflow-Stage-ID`, `X-Workflow-Step-ID`, `X-Invocation-Caller`), every audit event emitted during that invocation is tagged with the matching `workflow_id` / `stage_id` / `step_id` / `invocation_caller` fields. Header names are vendor-neutral so any A2A-compatible orchestrator can populate them. Direct A2A invocations (no orchestrator) omit the fields entirely — emitted JSON is byte-identical to the pre-correlation shape. See [Workflow correlation IDs](/docs/security/workflow-correlation) for the full reference, including outbound propagation for agent-to-agent flows.

### Authentication events

Every inbound request to `/tasks` emits exactly one of `auth_verify` or `auth_fail`.

**Successful authentication:**

```json
{
  "ts":"2026-05-24T00:50:01Z",
  "event":"auth_verify",
  "fields":{
    "method":"POST",
    "path":"/tasks/send",
    "provider":"aws_sigv4",
    "user_id":"arn:aws:sts::412664885516:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_PowerUserAccess_.../Naveen",
    "org_id":"412664885516",
    "token_kind":"sigv4",
    "groups_count":0,
    "remote_addr":"[::1]:62297"
  }
}
```

`user_id` is the canonical identifier the verifier returned (ARN for AWS, JWT
`sub` for OIDC/IAP/AAD). `org_id` is the AWS account, Entra tenant GUID, or
OIDC `tid`/`org_id`-mapped claim depending on the provider.

**Failed authentication:**

```json
{"ts":"...","event":"auth_fail","fields":{"reason":"rejected","token_kind":"sigv4","method":"POST","path":"/tasks/send","remote_addr":"[::1]:62200"}}
```

### Reason codes (`auth_fail.fields.reason`)

| Reason | What it means | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| `missing_token` | No auth-shaped headers at all | Caller forgot to authenticate |
| `not_for_me` | Bearer present but no provider claimed it | Wrong token format for the configured providers |
| `rejected` | Provider recognized + denied (allowlist miss, expired, bad sig, scope mismatch) | Check `allowed_principals` / `tenant_id` / token freshness |
| `invalid` | Token malformed (bad base64, unsupported alg, missing required field) | Token construction bug on the caller side |
| `provider_unavailable` | Verifier endpoint down (STS / JWKS / Graph 5xx, network error) | Provider-side incident; not a token issue |

### Token kind values (`fields.token_kind`)

Structural classification of what bytes were on the wire — safe to log:

| Value | Shape |
|---|---|
| `empty` | No token / no auth-shaped headers |
| `opaque` | Bearer with non-JWT, non-sigv4 shape (channel adapter loopback, custom verifier tokens) |
| `jwt` | Bearer with three base64url segments (`oidc`, `azure_ad`) |
| `sigv4` | Bearer with `forge-aws-v1.` prefix (`aws_sigv4` pre-signed URL token) |
| `iap_jwt` | `X-Goog-Iap-Jwt-Assertion` header present (`gcp_iap`) — also stamped on successful verify even if Bearer was simultaneously present |

### Audit pipeline grep recipes

Who called my agent in the last hour, by ARN/email?

```bash
jq -r 'select(.event=="auth_verify") | .fields.user_id' forge.log | sort | uniq -c
```

Why are requests failing?

```bash
jq -r 'select(.event=="auth_fail") | .fields.reason' forge.log | sort | uniq -c
```

Which agents called this one (in a mesh)?

```bash
jq -r 'select(.event=="auth_verify") | "\(.fields.user_id)"' forge.log | sort -u
```

See [Authentication](/docs/security/authentication) for the full provider chain and how
each provider populates these fields.
