```

## `forge mcp list`

Prints a table of every configured server with a quick reachability
probe. Always exits 0 — one server down is reported in its row, not
as a process error.

```
NAME      TRANSPORT  URL                                  STATE   TOOLS  REASON

```

## `forge mcp test <name>`

Connects to one server, runs `initialize` + `tools/list`, and prints
the discovered tools with truncated input schemas. Exits non-zero on
any failure (useful in CI).

For an `oauth` server this reads the token stored by `forge mcp login`,
honoring the same `mcp.token_store_path` (forge.yaml) / `MCP_TOKEN_STORE_PATH`
(env) override as `login`/`logout` — so a server logged in under a custom
store path resolves correctly. Run `forge mcp login <name>` first;
`test` does not perform interactive login.

Flags:
- `--call <tool>` — also invoke this tool after listing.
- `--args '<json>'` — JSON arguments for `--call`. Default `{}`.
- `--timeout <duration>` — per-RPC timeout. Default 10s.

Examples:

```sh
forge mcp test linear
forge mcp test linear --call list_issues --args '{"first":5}'
```

## `forge mcp login <name>`

Runs the OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow against the named server. Opens a
`127.0.0.1` loopback listener on a random port, opens the operator's
browser at the authorization endpoint, exchanges the returned code for
tokens, and persists them encrypted at
`~/.forge/credentials/mcp_<name>.json`.

**Discovery (#316):** when the server's `auth` block omits
`client_id` / `authorize_url` / `token_url`, login **discovers** them
from the server `url` (RFC 9728 → RFC 8414) and **dynamically registers**
a client (RFC 7591). The discovered endpoints + minted `client_id` are
persisted alongside the token as `mcp_reg_<name>.json` and reused on
refresh — login never re-registers. Explicit config in `forge.yaml`
overrides discovery. See
[configuration.md](/docs/mcp/configuration#oauth-discovery--dynamic-client-registration-316).

Requires `auth.type: oauth` in the server's config. Fails fast for
bearer / static / no-auth servers, and fails closed with a clear message
if a server advertises no metadata / no registration endpoint and no
`client_id` is configured.

**Agent-principal servers need no login.** A server with
`grant: client_credentials` (2LO — the agent authenticates as itself, #324)
mints its token at runtime; `forge mcp login <name>` on such a server
prints "no login needed" and exits successfully.

For Kubernetes deployments:

```sh
# On your laptop:
forge mcp login linear

# Bundle the credentials into a Secret. For a discovery-based server,
# include the registration record too (mcp_reg_<name>.json) — the
# runtime refresh path needs the discovered token_url + client_id:
kubectl create secret generic mcp-tokens \
  --from-file=mcp_linear.json=$HOME/.forge/credentials/mcp_linear.json \
  --from-file=mcp_reg_linear.json=$HOME/.forge/credentials/mcp_reg_linear.json

# In the pod spec:
volumeMounts:
  - name: mcp-tokens
    mountPath: /etc/forge/credentials
    readOnly: true
env:
  - name: HOME
    value: /etc/forge          # so llm/oauth.LoadCredentials finds the file
```

## `forge mcp logout <name>`

Deletes the stored OAuth token **and** the discovery/registration record
(`mcp_reg_<name>.json`) for the server. Idempotent. Clearing the
registration is the recovery path when an authorization server revokes
the dynamically-registered client: the next `forge mcp login` re-discovers
and re-registers from scratch.

```sh
forge mcp logout linear
```
