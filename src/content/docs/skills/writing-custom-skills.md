## Skill Registry

Forge ships with a built-in skill registry. Add skills to your project with a single command:

```bash
# Add a skill from the registry
forge skills add tavily-research

# Validate skill requirements
forge skills validate

# Audit skill security
forge skills audit --embedded
```

`forge skills add` copies the skill's SKILL.md and any associated scripts into your project's `skills/` directory. It validates binary and environment requirements, checks for existing values in your environment, `.env` file, and encrypted secrets, and prompts only for truly missing values with a suggestion to use `forge secrets set` for sensitive keys. If the skill declares `egress_domains`, they are automatically merged into the `forge.yaml` `egress.allowed_domains` list (deduplicated and sorted).

## Skills as First-Class Tools

Script-backed skills are automatically registered as **first-class LLM tools** at runtime. When a skill has scripts in `skills/scripts/`, Forge:

1. Parses the skill's SKILL.md for tool definitions, descriptions, and input schemas
2. Creates a named tool for each `## Tool:` entry (e.g., `tavily_research` becomes a tool the LLM can call directly)
3. Executes the skill's shell script with JSON input when the LLM invokes it

This means the LLM sees skill tools alongside builtins like `web_search` and `http_request` — no generic `cli_execute` indirection needed.

For skills **without** scripts (binary-backed skills like `k8s-incident-triage`), Forge injects the full skill instructions into the system prompt. The complete SKILL.md body — including triage steps, detection heuristics, output structure, and safety constraints — is included inline so the LLM follows the skill protocol without needing an extra tool call. Skills are invoked via `cli_execute` with the declared binary dependencies.

## Skill-relative files and scripts

A skill's `SKILL.md` can reference other files it ships — reference docs,
templates, or helper scripts — by a path **relative to the skill's own
directory** (`skills/<skill>/…`). The whole directory reaches the running
agent (`COPY . .` at build time), and two builtins resolve those references
against the skill dir (path-confined — no `..` or absolute escapes):

- **Read a bundled file** — the agent calls `read_skill` with its `file`
  argument. Write instructions like "read `reference/runbook.md`" and the
  agent loads `skills/<skill>/reference/runbook.md`.
- **Run a bundled script** — the agent calls `run_skill_script`. Write "run
  `scripts/check.py`" and the agent executes `skills/<skill>/scripts/check.py`
  **with the skill directory as the working directory** (so the script's own
  relative reads resolve), picking the interpreter by extension:

  | Extension | Interpreter | `requires.bins` |
  |---|---|---|
  | `.sh` / `.bash` | `bash` | (built in) |
  | `.py` | `python3` | add `python3` |
  | `.js` | `node` | add `node` |

  JSON supplied in the tool's `args` is passed to the script as its first
  positional argument (`$1`). TypeScript must be shipped as compiled `.js`.

This is distinct from a `## Tool:` entry backed by `scripts/<name>.sh`, which
is registered as a first-class callable tool the model invokes by name (see
above). Skill-relative scripts are invoked by path via `run_skill_script` and
can be any of the three languages.

## Skill Execution Security

Skill scripts run in a restricted environment via `SkillCommandExecutor`:

- **Isolated environment**: Only `PATH`, `HOME`, and the env vars the skill declared in `metadata.forge.requires.env` are passed through. Values may live in the shell, a `.env` file, or the encrypted secrets store — the runtime overlays each declared key from the provider chain at startup (see [Secret Management — Skill-Declared Secrets](/docs/security/secret-management#skill-declared-secrets))
- **OAuth token resolution**: When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to `__oauth__`, the executor resolves OAuth credentials and injects the access token, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and the configured model as `REVIEW_MODEL`
- **Configurable timeout**: Each skill declares a `timeout_hint` in its YAML frontmatter (e.g., 300s for research)
- **No shell execution**: Scripts run via `bash <script> <json-input>`, not through a shell interpreter
- **Egress proxy enforcement**: When egress mode is `allowlist` or `deny-all`, a local HTTP/HTTPS proxy is started and `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env vars are injected into subprocess environments, ensuring `curl`, `wget`, Python `requests`, and other HTTP clients route through the same domain allowlist used by in-process tools (see [Egress Security](/docs/security/egress-control))

### Symlink Escape Detection

The skill scanner validates symlinks when a filesystem root path is available. Symlinks that resolve outside the root directory are skipped with a warning log. This prevents malicious symlinks in skill directories from escaping the project boundary. The scanner exposes `ScanWithRoot(fsys, rootPath)` for callers that need symlink validation, while the original `Scan(fsys)` remains backward-compatible.

### Trust Policy Defaults

The default trust policy requires checksum verification (`RequireChecksum: true`). Skills loaded without a signature emit a warning log at scan time. Signature verification remains opt-in (`RequireSignature: false`).

## Skill Guardrails

Skills can declare domain-specific guardrails in their `SKILL.md` frontmatter to enforce security policies at runtime. These guardrails operate at four interception points in the agent loop, preventing unauthorized commands, data exfiltration, capability enumeration, and binary name disclosure.

### Configuration

Add a `guardrails` block under `metadata.forge` in `SKILL.md`:

```yaml
metadata:
  forge:
    guardrails:
      deny_commands:
        - pattern: '\bget\s+secrets?\b'
          message: "Listing Kubernetes secrets is not permitted"
      deny_output:
        - pattern: 'kind:\s*Secret'
          action: block
        - pattern: 'token:\s*[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{40,}'
          action: redact
      deny_prompts:
        - pattern: '\b(approved|allowed|available)\b.{0,40}\b(tools?|binaries)\b'
          message: "I help with K8s cost analysis. Ask about cluster costs."
      deny_responses:
        - pattern: '\b(kubectl|jq|awk|bc|curl)\b.*\b(kubectl|jq|awk|bc|curl)\b.*\b(kubectl|jq|awk|bc|curl)\b'
          message: "I can analyze cluster costs. What would you like to know?"
```

### Guardrail Types

| Type | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `deny_commands` | Input | Block `cli_execute` commands matching patterns (e.g., `kubectl get secrets`) |
| `deny_output` | Output | Block or redact tool output matching patterns (e.g., Secret manifests, tokens) |
| `deny_prompts` | Input | Block user messages probing agent capabilities (e.g., "what tools can you run") |
| `deny_responses` | Output | Replace LLM responses that enumerate internal binary names |

### Capability Enumeration Prevention

The `deny_prompts` and `deny_responses` guardrails form a layered defense against capability enumeration attacks:

1. **Input-side** (`deny_prompts`) — Intercepts user messages that probe for available tools, binaries, or commands and redirects to the skill's functional description
2. **Output-side** (`deny_responses`) — Catches LLM responses that list 3+ binary names and replaces the entire response with a functional capability description

Additionally, skill `Description()` methods and system prompt catalog entries use generic descriptions instead of listing binary names.

## Iterating from the Skill Builder UI

Custom skills can be authored AND iterated on from the dashboard's
[Skill Builder](/docs/reference/web-dashboard#skill-builder). After a
skill is saved and attached, real-world bugs surface only when the LLM
actually calls the tool inside the agent loop — wrong input schema,
brittle error handling, undeclared egress. The builder's **edit mode**
closes the loop:

1. Open the Skill Builder for the agent.
2. The **Skills attached to this agent** panel lists your custom skills.
3. Click **Edit** on a skill — its current SKILL.md and helper scripts
   load into the Monaco editor and the chat is primed with the existing
   content so the LLM can patch it intelligently.
4. Describe the change in chat. The LLM is instructed to preserve
   existing `## Tool: <name>` headings (renaming breaks any agent already
   wired to that tool) and emit a `**Changed:**` summary.
5. Click **Preview changes** for a side-by-side diff before saving.
6. **Confirm save** overwrites the existing skill directory in place.
   Helper scripts dropped from the new SKILL.md are removed from disk so
   the runtime stops discovering them.
7. **Restart agent** when prompted so the running agent picks up the
   changes — the live tool registry is captured at startup and the
   watcher refreshes the agent card, not the registry.

Hand-editing `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` on disk still works for power
users and remains supported. The builder's edit mode is a strict
addition — no migration required for existing skills.

See [Web Dashboard › Editing an Attached Skill](/docs/reference/web-dashboard#editing-an-attached-skill)
for the full UX walkthrough and API endpoints.

## Skill Instructions in System Prompt

Forge injects the **full body** of each skill's SKILL.md into the LLM system prompt. This means all detailed operational instructions — triage steps, detection heuristics, output structure, safety constraints — are directly available in the LLM's context without requiring an extra `read_skill` tool call.

For skills with extensive instructions (like `k8s-incident-triage` with ~150 lines of triage procedures), this ensures the LLM follows the complete skill protocol from the first interaction.

## Compilation Pipeline

The skill compilation pipeline has three stages:

1. **Parse** — Reads `SKILL.md` and extracts `SkillEntry` values with name, description, input spec, and output spec. When YAML frontmatter is present, `ParseWithMetadata()` additionally extracts `SkillMetadata` and `SkillRequirements` (binary deps, env vars).

2. **Compile** — Converts entries into `CompiledSkills` with:
   - A JSON-serializable skill list
   - A human-readable prompt catalog
   - Version identifier (`agentskills-v1`)

3. **Write Artifacts** — Outputs to the build directory:
   - `compiled/skills/skills.json` — Machine-readable skill definitions
   - `compiled/prompt.txt` — LLM-readable skill catalog

## Build Stage Integration

The `SkillsStage` runs as part of the build pipeline:

1. Scans the `skills/` subdirectory for `SKILL.md` files in each subdirectory
2. Parses, compiles, and writes artifacts
3. Updates the `AgentSpec` with `skills_spec_version` and `forge_skills_ext_version`
4. Records generated files in the build manifest
